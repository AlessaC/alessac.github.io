title: Thoughts on CSS Pre-Processors
---

From my short time using SASS (a CSS pre-processor), I can honestly say I quite like being able to type a few elements up in a mixin or as variables then copy and paste one line of code into every selector I want those specific parameters for. It was a little bit confusing trying to set up Ruby and SASS using the Command Line though, and also potentially dangerous for the computer, apparently. I’m not sure if there’s a way to bypass that but if not, it should probably be addressed.

As this is my first time hearing about and working with CSS pre-processors, I still do not know all the features that come with them, especially since I’ve only been using one: SASS. From the bit of work I have done using SASS I would have to say that I think it’s neat and the ability to use variables or mixing to easily change multiple elements of an object’s CSS with just one line of code is great. 

After reading the articles and finding out that with mixins, you are duplicating the same code and making the file size larger, I would have to say that I think CSS pre-processors should probably be used only on smaller websites that don’t have as many defined elements or the large file sizes could pose problems. The other problem with using pre-processing on large websites is that when you try to edit a mixin or pre-processing variable, you may not realize just how many elements/selectors you are affecting with that change, potentially causing disastrous effects on the site. While I don’t think pre-processing should be written off completely, I believe it should only be used on certain projects rather than being an end-all-be-all.
