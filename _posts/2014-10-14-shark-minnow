title: Thoughts on "A Game of Shark and Minnow"
---

I really enjoyed the combination of article and waypoint technique into a single web page. The use of short videos with audio during the Waypoint sections was captivating and drew me into the story more than plain text with a few static images would have. The scrolling waypoints themselves gave me more actions to complete which was engaging as well.

Although I appreciate the audio used in this article, I feel like it could have used some voice overs, perhaps of the captions you were scrolling by? Or maybe a little bit more background info on the topic at hand. The map scrolling segments were a bit disorienting with the static text and the moving map text competing for my/the readers attention, although that may just be a personal problem. Perhaps it could have been improved with a bit more of a delay between the static text appearing and the map animation/video completing. Finally, with the mobile version of the page it seemed as if the video parts of the scrolling sections were replaced by different pictures in some parts rather than all being stills from the desktop videos which made me feel like the desktop user was not getting the full experience unless they also checked the mobile version. The map animations didnâ€™t seem to have this issue.

Overall, it was a great page with no detrimental issues in my opinion.
