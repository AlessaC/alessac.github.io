## Why I'm Here

I became interested in web development on accident actually. Two years ago, my mother basically forced me to take a basic computing course in high school which touched upon microsoft office, adobe, and a bit of web design. Well, when I got to the web design/development component I almost instantly fell in love. So after high school, where I took more in -depth web design classes after the 1st, I decided to move to Chicago and pursue an education in computer studies, focusing on web development/design.

Now that I look back, I'm thankful that my mother pushed me into taking that class because I don't know what I'd be doing or where I'd be right now if hadn't taken that class. I used to think coding websites was impossible and that I'd never get to a level where anything of mine would look aesthetically pleasing or professional, but slowly I'm building up my knowledge to get me to that point.

### Current Inspiration

- [Silent Hill:](http://silenthill.wikia.com/wiki/Silent_Hill_Wiki) The atmosphere the music makes along with the thought process behind the monsters(they are a projection of events, issues, etc in the main characters life). I've just never seen anything like it and I notice new things every time I play.
- [Mechanical Animals:](http://www.mansonwiki.com/wiki/Mechanical_Animals_%28album%29) This album really kickstarted my love of futuristic things and aliens when I was in middle school, the look of the band and the sounds inspired me the minute I encountered this.
- [Nubby Twiglet:](http://www.nubbytwiglet.com/) One of my first female web design inspirations, I love her aesthetic, especially the red cross motif she uses a lot. I aspire to be as successful as her once I'm her age.
